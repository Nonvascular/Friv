                My favorate thing to do in Boyscouts is mostly the camping. Being in the program has taken me many
                places
                and
                showed me how to do things like rafting, survive, and more!

            <ul class="textsm">
                <li>Skiing because it makes me feel like im flying and its literaly riding snow.</li>

                <li>Biking because it feels good to ride outside but it does hurt to sit for a long time.</li>

                <li>Marching Band because its music and I love music and hearing the power of hundreds of people playing
                    instruments.</li>

                <li>Camping because its very peaceful to sleep under no noise and nature around you.</li>

    <h5 class="team">My Reason Why</h5>
    <p class="text">My name is Miqueas and I go to creekside highschool. The reason why I joined the YGT200 class is
        because I
        wanted learn more about coding and things of that nature. The reason I joined YGT in the first place is because
        I wanted to try coding out but I wasnt really focused on that much. As I grew in the subject I more and more
        enjoyed coding and learning how to code. For some reason I also enjoyed being confused on why my page just broke
        and seeing that the smallest or most futile thing messed me up.
